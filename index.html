<h1>Hopium administered</h1>
<p>Rise and shine Mr Freeman. Rise and shine... Not that I wish to imply you've been sleeping on the job, no one is more deserving of a rest and all of the effort would've gone to waste. The right man in the wrong place can make all the difference. So wake up Mr Freeman, wake up and smell the ashes.</p>

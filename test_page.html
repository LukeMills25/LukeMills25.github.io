        Panic! In-static! Out-manic! <br>
        Don't you find it all romanic? the way things used to be? <br>
        Classic! Estatic! It's magic! <br>
        To trip the light fantastic! <br>
        Repeat it after me! <br>

        This is how it should be. <br>
        In studio seats. <br>
        My ego wired in the CRT <br>
        We can skip the sign off <br>
        and ol' familar scenes. <br>
        Repeating this is how it should be! <br>
